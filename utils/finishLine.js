${logSymbols.info} ${yellow(`One-time setup:`)}
1. Download all plugin assets in the ${green(`.wordpress-org`)} directory
2. Go to ${dim(`${url}/settings/secrets`)}
Click "Add New Secret" add name ${green(
			`SVN_USERNAME`
		)} and fill the value with your username
Click "Add New Secret" again; add name ${green(
			`SVN_PASSWORD`
		)} and fill the value with your password

${logSymbols.success} ${green(`Now what?!`)}
- Now for each commit/push to master your assets & readme will get deployed
- And for each new tag/push a new version of plugin will be deployed
- So, go ahead, make change, git commit, and then run:

${green(`git tag 2.0.0 && git push --tags`)}
${dim(`# Considering 2.0.0 is the new version`)}
`)
	);
};
